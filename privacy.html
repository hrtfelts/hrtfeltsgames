            Most games on this site will use HTML local storage which means that the game data will be stored on your device and only your device. The only time where data leaves your device is through Google Analytics. With Google
            Analytics, we make sure your privacy is kept in mind. Me, being a huge privacy advocate is the only one that views any data collected, and it is only used to understand people who visit the site.

        <h3>Statistics tracking</h3>
        <p>
            This game measures visitors by using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within the game, how you arrived at the game and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous - so we
            donâ€™t know who you are; just that <em>somebody</em> visited the game.
        </p>
        <p>The information collected from analytics helps us understand what games are doing well, how people arrive at a game etc. Like most games, we use this information to make it better.</p>

This repo hosts my website. It is a revamp to the old one that can be found [here](https://github.com/3kh0/website-v1).

**You can view the actual site with this link: [3kh0.github.io](https://3kh0.github.io)**
> If this link is blocked, read the [Unblocking](https://github.com/3kh0/3kh0.github.io#unblocking) section!

## Cloning

```

```
or, [download the repo here](https://github.com/3kh0/3kh0.github.io/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

## Unblocking

If the main site is blocked, there are many ways you can get around this!

### Use the website

People have already made alterate links to the website, they are listed in the discord server.

This is the most easiest way to bypass school blocking!

### Host the website

Below are some of the options you can use to deploy your own copy of the site. **If you do not know what you are doing, it is suggested that you use a link someone is currently hosting!**
